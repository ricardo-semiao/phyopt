This packages implements a two-step, population-based, hybrid optimization  algorithm, for solving problems of the form:

$$
  \max_{x, \tilde{x}} f(x, \tilde{x}) ~~s.t.~~ g(x, \tilde{x}) \geq 0,~ \tilde{g}(\tilde{x}) \geq 0\\
  x \in X,~ \tilde{x} \in \tilde{X}
$$

The paper fully describing the motivation, theoretical framework, and method design will be made public soon.

For now, see the viggnette `example.Rmd`, which contains a simple example but a thorough explanation of how the package works. Additionally, see the documentation for the `optimize_phy()` function, which is the main function of the package

## Installation
