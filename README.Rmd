This packages implements a two-step, population-based, hybrid optimization  algorithm, for solving problems of the form:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
  \max_{x, \tilde{x}} f(x, \tilde{x}) ~~s.t.~~ g(x, \tilde{x}) \geq 0,~ \tilde{g}(\tilde{x}) \geq 0,\\
  x \in X,~ \tilde{x} \in \tilde{X}
\end{array}
$$

The paper fully describing the motivation, theoretical framework, and method design is available at `vignette("theoretical_framework", package = "phyopt")`.

For now, see the vignette `vignette("example", package = "phyopt")`, which contains a simple example but a thorough explanation of how the package works. Additionally, see the documentation for the `optimize_phy()` function, which is the main function of the package

**Disclaimer:** this package is in the early most stage of life. It hasn't been thoroughly tested and can present several bugs. I don't recommend using it for large-scale projects, yet.

Please report any problems as a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/ricardo-semiao/morphdown/issues). Other comments can be posted as a GitHub [discussion](https://github.com/ricardo-semiao/morphdown/discussions), or sent in my email below. Thank you!

## Installation

You can install the development version of phyopt like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ricardo-semiao/phyopt")
```


## Development Comments

This package is young, and puts much of the responsibility of the optimization on the user. Having said that, I think it is decently solid. Once I implement tests and run more examples, I figure it will be already stable.

Some of the more important features I plan to add in the future are:

- The `testthat` package structure is created for the package, but I haven't had the time to write unir tests yet.
- Add more complicated examples to `vignette("example", package = "phyopt")`.
- Expand the suggested metrics on `get_metrics`, also add suggestions formatters for the `logger` object.
- Add suggested operators for `optimize_phy()`, with common initializers, optimizers, and updaters from the literature.
- Add an `on.exit()` call to `optimize_pbhy()`, such that it safely returns what it had before reaching an eventual error.
- Create `summary()` and `plot()` methods for the `optimize_pbhy()` result.

Note that this package:

- Follows the [tydiverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
  - Using the [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org/) and [lintr](https://lintr.r-lib.org/) packages for style consistency.
- Uses [testthat 3](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) for automate tests.
- Uses [rlang](https://rlang.r-lib.org/) frameworks for _tidy eval_ and _rlang errors_.
